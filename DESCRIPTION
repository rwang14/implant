Description: The package "implant" includes functionality for image processing and functional data analysis, which is able to provide statistical growth curve analysis for plant traits extracted from the input images. For image processing, the package provides methods including thresholding, hidden Markov random field model, etc. For the growth curve analysis, this package can produce nonparametric curve fitting with its confidence region. A functional ANOVA model to test for the treatment and genotype effects on the growth curve dynamics is also provided.
